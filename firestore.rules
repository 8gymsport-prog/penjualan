/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Kassa Kilat.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only
 * access their own data. This is achieved through path-based authorization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user account information.
 * - /users/{userId}/products/{productId}: Stores product information for each user.
 * - /users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transaction information for each user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own data.
 * - Listing of all users is allowed for username/email lookup during login.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The data structure is designed to avoid the need for `get()` calls in security rules.
 *   Each document is located under a path that includes the user's ID,
 *   making it easy to enforce ownership.
